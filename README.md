Implementing Header Guards
To prevent multiple inclusions of classes and functions in your header files, add header guards. Use the following structure:
#ifndef HEADER_NAME_H
#define HEADER_NAME_H

// Class and function declarations go here

#endif // HEADER_NAME_H

Including Necessary Header Files
In your main program and other class files, ensure that you include the necessary header files. This will enable different components of your program to interact seamlessly by recognizing each otherâ€™s classes and functions.

Defining Global Variables
For any global variables, such as an ID, declare them as static within the appropriate class (e.g., LibraryItem). Alternatively, you can declare the variable as extern in the header file and define it in the corresponding source file to allow sharing across different files without encountering multiple definition errors.

Creating a Makefile
Write a Makefile that includes a clean option. This option will remove any generated object files and binaries, helping you maintain a tidy workspace. By doing this, you can easily delete any unnecessary files after building the project.

Executing the Makefile
After writing the Makefile, execute it to start the compilation process. This will generate the necessary object files and output files, which can then be run to implement the program.
